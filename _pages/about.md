I am **Tao Zhang (Âº†Èü¨)**, currently a PhD student at Wuhan University, under the guidance of Prof. [Shunping Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FjoRmF4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Yu Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=23SZHUwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). Additionally, I am currently interning at Skywork AI, where I am advised by Dr. [Xiangtai Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FL3ReD0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Shuicheng Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=DNuiPHwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Prior to this, I completed internships at the Y-Tech Lab of Kuaishou Technology. I obtained my master's degree from Wuhan University under the supervision of Prof. [Shunping Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FjoRmF4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

My research interests encompass:

1. Image and video understanding tasks.
2. Multi-modal learning with Large Language Models (LLMs).
3. Remote Sensing.
